Welcome to AutoModpack,

What is this?
AutoModpack is a Minecraft modification that aims to simplify the process of updating modpacks for servers. With this mod, players no longer have to manually update each mod or the entire modpack. The tedious task of updating is handled automatically, making the experience more seamless and enjoyable.

[(A bit outdated) Showcase (YouTube video)](https://youtu.be/lPPzaNPn8g8)

I do not take credit for any of the content that can be downloaded from the mod. Likely all materials, except for the mod itself, were created by various talented individuals!

## Key features
- Auto modpack updating for seamless player experience.
- Effortless modpack management for admins, including the ability to easily manage mods, configs, resource packs, and more.
- Direct downloads from modrinth and curseforge.
- Dynamic modpack updates without disrupting player experience.
- Quick and simple installation process.

## How it works?
On server AutoModpack generates a file called modpack-content.json on the server, which contains all the mods, configs, resource packs, and other necessary files for your modpack. The server also hosts this file, as well as all the files contained within it, on an HTTP server.

When a client joins the server, the modpack automatically downloads the modpack-content.json file from HTTP server, check modrinth and curseforge APIs to get direct downloads of as most as possible files and then it downloads all the files contained within modpack-content, if they haven't been installed before on client. The client simply needs to wait a few seconds for the files to download, install, and restart the game. Once the process is complete, the client can join the server again and enjoy the modpack

## Is it secure?

Simply, no. This mod allows ANY server running it to put ANY file in your game folder, such as a virus or a keylogger. So if you are a client please make sure you trust your server administrator and as a good measure make sure to scan your games folders for malicious content. Please direct any useful security material to the github issues. However as long you know server is safe and owner isn't impostor, you should be good.

This is only intended for personal use. Other developers work very hard on their mods and simply visiting their website, modrinth/curseforge page, or github is just a common courtesy. Please don't use this to mass distribute other people's mods without explicit permission. Depending on the copyright and/or pattent laws in your area using this mod with other developer's mods for a commercial purpose could be ILLEGAL, check licenses.


## How to use

First of all download the latest version of the mod from [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/automodpack/versions) or use our [modified version of fabric installer](https://github.com/Skidamek/AutoModpack-Installer/releases/tag/Latest) which will install fabric loader and AutoModpack.

Put it into the `/mods/` folder of your minecraft/server installation.

Launch the game your game/server.

**- Client**

1. Join the server. Now modpack will be magically downloaded and installed. You will only need to click few buttons to confirm download and restart the game.
2. Join the server again and Enjoy!

**- Server**

1. Open/Forward port (default: `30037` on TCP protocol) on your server! need to host modpack. (Port needs to be different from port used by minecraft server)
2. Restart server

and you are good to go!

Doesn't work? Check `hostIp` in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json` and make sure it's correct. (same as your server ip/domain)

#### Do you want to add more content to your modpack?
- By default, the modpack will automatically synchronize all mods, configs from default server directories to the modpack. (Check `syncedFiles` list in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`)
- To add more mods to your server, place them in the `/automodpack/host-modpack/mods/` directory.
  And so analogically to add shaderpacks, put them in `/automodpack/host-modpack/shaderpacks/`. You can create any subdirectories you need within `/automodpack/host-modpack/` folder.
- Or add whatever file/folder from server main directory to the `syncedFiles` list in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`

#### Do you want to delete some mods from modpack?
- Just delete what file you want to delete from directory on your server.
- Or check and delete whatever file/folder from list `syncedFiles` in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`

#### Do you want to exclude some mods from `syncedFiles`?
- Just add them to the `excludeSyncedFiles` list in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`

## Commands

- `/automodpack` - Status of automodpack and general help.
- `/automodpack generate` - Generate new modpack-content.json file on server, which results in modpack update for clients.
- `/automodpack host` - Status of modpack hosting.
- `/automodpack host start` - Start modpack hosting.
- `/automodpack host stop` - Stop modpack hosting.
- `/automodpack host restart` - Restart modpack hosting.
- `/automodpack config reload` - Reload config files.


## Common problem

**Got errors every time you try to download the modpack / modpack-content is null?**

- Take a look at your server log after starting the server. See if there's a notice about the modpack host launch and make sure the IP is correct (it may only be the last digits of the IP).

- If the IP isn't right, head over to the config file and change the "hostIp" to your server's correct IP (without the port).

- Having trouble with the local host IP? No worries, just repeat the process but change "hostLocalIp" instead.
